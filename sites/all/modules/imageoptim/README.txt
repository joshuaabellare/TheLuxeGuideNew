This module compress your images for optimal file-size using the ImageOptim API
service, and can be used in three ways:

1) Optimizing images on file upload.
2) Using the image optimitzation service as image effect in image styles.
3) Scanning image files and optimizing massively.

Youâ€™ll need to obtain an API key/username from ImageOptim:
https://imageoptim.com/api/register

Images are send to ImageOptim web service using an HTTP Request and then
donwloaded and replaced with an optimize version. If you want to save outbound
bandwidth and are using an optimization image effect, add an earlier standard
scale effect to limit the size of the image sent.

= Installation =

* Download the ImageOptim module and enable it.
* Go to Admin > Config > Media > Image Optim (admin/config/media/imageoptim) and
  set your API Key.

== How to optimize images on file upload ==

* Go to Admin > Config > Media > Image Optim (admin/config/media/imageoptim) and
  check the "Optimize images on file upload" checkbox.

== How to add an image effecte optimitzation ==

* Go to Admin > Config > Media > Image Styles (admin/config/media/image-styles)
  and create or edit your image styles.
* Add Image Optim effect to every style that you want to optimize using
  ImageOptim webservice.

If you apply multiple effects set the Image Optimizer effect the last one,
because if the image is re-saved using another toolkit you can lose the image
optimization.

== How to scan and optimize image files manually ==

* Go to Admin > Config > Media > Image Optim (admin/config/media/imageoptim) and
  run "Optimize all images" or "Optimize new images" in manual optimization
  fieldset.

New images are all images added since last manual optimization run, you probably
will not need to use this feature if you have optimization on file upload
enabled.
